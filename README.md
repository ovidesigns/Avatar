This code is part of a performance art piece completed for University of Washington Course DXARTS 472 exploring inverted relationships of power between humans and the natural world

# Details
The artist is connected to a TENS Unit muscle stimulator that is coded to activate according to
data collected by sensors on a plant. Depending on how prototyping goes, this data will either
be translated live or be pre-recorded and displayed on the day of the exhibition via the artist’s
body in a short, live performance. Should the data be collected and translated live– in order to
have any significant moment-to-moment variation in plant stimulus readings– audience
members will be encouraged to interact with the plant and see the artist react as the plant’s
avatar to their input.

The goal of this piece is to call into question who has the power in this relationship normally and
then subvert it in the gallery. The plant is enacting its will upon the artist in a way that mirrors
mankind’s subjugation of nature. Preceding the industrial revolution, this relationship would have
been a little more symbiotic. At its base level the two natural forces– ourselves and plant life–
sustain one another. Primary examples of these feedback loops include our ability to breathe life
into one another and benefit mutually from agricultural practices.
Variations in the ways plant data is collected will impact the overarching themes of the piece. If
the only input is from the plant itself– no human interference– then that makes things different
from the artist's live reactions to audience members interacting with the plant. While one
subverts roles, the other simply reveals them in a format that is easier for people to empathize
with. Ideally, the piece would be doing the former.
